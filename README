DEVICE DRIVER FOR EEPROM

NOTE: FOR TASK1 INCLUDED THE OPTION TO WRITE A BYTE TO A SPECIFIC LOCATION. So given a page no and position you can write a single character to it. It does not update the address counter though.

Seperate readme files are present in all directories.

all drivers are name I2C-FLASH.ko
all test programs are i2c-test-app

all tasks will initialized the EEPROM to all X. ie they will write X to all 512 pages.

Thus, if you do insmod or start Task1 please be patient as it will take around 5 seconds to initialize. The reason I did this is so that you have the option to read 512 pages.

The programs display a  menu of the options available.

To compile

Please type make in all the directories.

To run...navigate to the current directory

Task1
-----------
 ./i2c-test-app
------------
Task2 and Task 3
-----------------------------------
 insmod I2C-FLASH.ko
./i2c-test-app
-----------------------------------

The range of pages is 0-511.

Any value above or below it is invalid!!.

Task3 will give a worded output of the return value.

-2 --> WORK SUBMITTED
-1 --> YET TO BE HANDLED
-3 --> WORK FAILED
0 --> SUCCESS AND THE RELAVENT OUTPUT IS DISPLAYED


The program autmatically increments the address after every read and write operation.

You have the option to randomly generate a string but note that it will not generate a size that is equal to the no. of pages that you wanted to write to.

All driver and test programs are almost similar with relatively few differences.

Please either run diff FILE1 FILE2 to see the minor changes 

I have also commented all the changed parts of the program.
